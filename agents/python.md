- ``dict.get`` usually indicates bad control flow. How could we guarantee that a key is in the dictionary?
- always use mandatory keyword arguments if the purpose and order of positional argument wouldn't be obvious at call site
- always use kw_only for dataclasses
- variable names should be lower camel case. If I wrote code that doesn't follow this, point it out.
